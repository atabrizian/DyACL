        This is a really lightweight implementation of ACL. It can be used both for static and
        dynamic (Database Driven) ACL which was the main purpose of this library's
        creation.
        <br>
        <br>
        But at first place why to invent the wheel again?! The answer is, there was a
        project of mine that needed ACL for managing access to different Files and Folders,
        which meant there will be lots of Rules that should be loaded from database. One
        of my friends suggested "Zend Permission Acl". I downloaded zend acl and
        went through its documentation, but it seemed vague to me and I was in shortage of
        time, so I decided to write an ACL library myself and after some improvements I
        believe its better than "Zend Permission ACL"! So here is my library. I will shed
        some light on "Why this library is better than Zend ACL" later on.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you're curious why I named it &quot;DyAcl&quot;, I should say it's abbreviation of
        &quot;Damn You ACL&quot;, because I had some difficulty understanding the
        ACL implementation process! :) Now it is &quot;Dynamic ACL&quot;!
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Remember</b> that this library does need just an array of anything so you're
        not forced to use database. I've also provided a class that
        extends from DyAcl and Uses "PDO" to load data from database.

    <div class="h3">How it works</div>
    <div>
        1. This library should be loaded from namespace context. You can load it by
        using composer. If you are using lower versions of php which does not support
        namespace you need to replace namespaces with &quot;include&quot; statements.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. Find out who is visiting your website. Each and every user even a guest should
        have an ID that will help you differenciate one from another.
        <br>
        <br>
        3. Every user has at least one role and as many roles you desire is possible.
        Roles are different according to each site. It can be as simple as "Administrator,
        user" or it can be as complex as roles are defined by administrator on fly. But
        it makes no difference because you store these in "roles" table and when you find
        out what is your users ID it's as easy as a simple database query. Selected the
        roles from database, define them for library by "setRoles" function:
        <br>
        <br>
<pre>
    $roles = array(); // here assign what you selected from "roles" table

    $dyacl = new DyACL();
    $dyacl->setRoles($roles);
</pre>
        <br>
        if there is an special role that you desire to be added on fly add it by
        "setRole" function. For example you have a role named "admin" and you want to
        assign it to this user:
        <br>
        <br>
<pre>
    $dyacl->setRole("admin");
</pre>
        <br>
        It's better to use role_id if you need to load further roles later.
        <br>
        <br>
        4. When you have a list of current user's roles you can select related "Rules"
        from it's table. After that define these rules for the library by using
        "setRules" function.
        <br>
        <br>
<pre>
    $rules = array();// here assign the rules you selected from database.

    $dyacl->setRules($rules);
</pre>
        <br>
        The library will define every resource that is mentioned by rules for itself so
        you do not need to define any resource explicitly. Access to a resource that is
        unknown for the library would be denied by default. In case you need to define
        any rule on fly go on and use "setRule" function. Each "rule" consists of a
        "resource" name, a "privilege", for which the possible values are 'allow' and
        'deny', and finally an "action" which is by default "all" which means user is
        allowed to do whatever is possible. Other possible actions are Create, Read,
        Update and Delete.
        <br>
        <br>
        For example you want to deny any access to a folder named "secrets":
        <br>
        <br>
<pre>
    $dyacl->setRule("secrets", DyACL::DENY);
</pre>
        <br>
        or you need to allow just viewing:
        <br>
        <br>
<pre>
    $dyacl->setRule("secrets", DyACL::ALLOW, DyACL::ACTION_READ);
</pre>
        <br>
        Remeber that DyACL::DENY is equal to "deny" and DyACL::ALLOW is equal to "allow".
        <br>
        <br>
        5. Finally checking whether user has access to a resource or not is possible by
        "isAllowed" function:
        <br>
        For example after all this you want to check whether user is allowed access to
        the folder named "secrets" or not:
        <br>
        <br>
<pre>
    if ($dyacl->isAllowed("secrets") {
        echo "Yes, you are allowed";
    }
    else {
        echo "Access Denied!";
    }
</pre>
        <br>
        OR maybe you want to check whether the user is allowed to delete the folder "secrets":
        <br><br>
<pre>
    if ($dyacl->isAllowed("secrets", DyACL::ACTION_DELETE) {
        echo "Yes, you are allowed";
    }
    else {
        echo "Access Denied!";
    }
</pre>
        <br>
        As I said previously there is a class extended from DyAcl class, named DyAclPDO, which
        uses PDO to load data from database:
        <br><br>
<pre>
    $dyAcl = new DyAclPDO("mysql:host={$sampleHost};dbname={$sampleDbName};", $sampleUsername, $samplePassword);

    $sampleUserId = 1;
    $dyAcl->prepareAcl($sampleUserId); //this function loads users' roles and related rules
                                       //from database

    $dyAcl->isAllowed('secret');
</pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="box" id="sample">

    I have provided a sample file in DyAcl repo. I have also written some Unit Tests,
    taking a look at them may clear context of using this library.

<div class="box">
    <div class="h3" id="why">Why to choose &quot;DyACL&quot; over &quot;Zend
        Permission ACL&quot;?</div>

    I guess this topic would be interesting for whom has already used &quot;Zend Permission
    ACL&quot; or other ACL libraries. What follows is what I found out by testing
    &quot;Zend Permission ACL&quot;, if you can prove they're wrong, let me know And I
    will correct.<br><br>

    <ol>
        <li>Explicit Resource and role Definition<br><br> In &quot;Zend
            Permission ACL&quot; roles should be defined explicitly and in order to define
            resource specific rules, resources should be defined previously. It means you should
            define all resources in a database table load them and add them to &quot;Zend
            Permission ACL&quot; and always maintain this table for extra resources or resources
            that do not exist anymore. What if you don't? The library will throw an Exception
            saying the resource has not been defined. This really complicates situation and is not
            memory efficient. But in DyAcl library itself adds resources whenever you define Rules.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Rule Definition Context<br><br>We know that for each resource all possible actions
            are Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD). In &quot;Zend Permission ACL&quot;
            When you do not provide &quot;Privilege&quot; for your rule, it assumes you
            mean every possible action, and when you are using &quot;isAllowed&quot;
            function with no privilege specified it checks for this rule. But imagine you have
            a user who is a member of 4 different groups and each one of these groups
            have a privilege for one specific action. when you ask &quot;Zend Permission ACL&quot;
            that if this user is allowed for all actions with leaving privilege parameter null in
            &quot;isAllowed&quot; function Zend says NO, means user is not allowed!!!
            So what to do? you have to define 4 different rules for each resource and
            check each rule separately to get the correct result which will cause a huge
            rule table and huge <b>memory usage</b> will follow.<br>I've solved
            this in DyAcl. "all" keyword allows or denies access on all possible actions and
            you can check all access with the keyword "all" too. so its easy as pie!
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Order in &quot;Allow&quot; and &quot;Deny&quot;!!!<br><br>
            In &quot;Zend Permission ACL&quot; Rule definition order is important! Means
            when you have two rules for one resource which one denies access and the other
            allows it, the result will be different depending on which one is loaded first!
            In &quot;DyAcl&quot; allow is more powerful, and by default everything
            is denied, so you just need to allow access to specific resources and order of rules
            does not matter anymore.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Execution time<br><br>Because of differences in rule definition context between
            &quot;Zend Permission ACL&quot; and &quot;DyAcl&quot; I was unable to provide data
            on execution time over large amount of rules but I've tested these two libraries
            for a small amount of data and same rules which you can find in
            <a href="https://github.com/ghost098/DyACL">DyACL</a> repo and
            <a href="https://github.com/ghost098/ZendAclTest">ZendAclTest</a> repo and
            what follows is average execution time of pdosample file in Dyacl repo and
            zend_sample in ZandAclTest repo, taken from <b>Xdebug Profiler</b>:

    <div>
        -Q: What happens if a "role" denies access to a resource but another one allows it?
        <br>
        -A: &quot;allow&quot; is more powerful than &quot;deny&quot; so result will be
        "allow".
        <br><br>
        -Q: Do I need to define each and every resource?!
        <br>
        -A: NO. There may be lots of resources defined in your database. Loading all
        that can use lots of memory or may be impossible for large projects. You just
        load specific rules that are related to current user and the library will handle
        all the rest.
